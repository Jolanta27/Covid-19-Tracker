Covid-19-Tracker

Covid-19 Tracker is a project bootstrapped with Create React App. I used framework Material-UI as well to build simple components and took data from https://disease.sh/v3/covid-19/all.

You have to install node and npm to start this project.

Youâ€™ll need to have Node >= 10 on your local development machine.

npm is distributed with Node.js- which means that when you download Node.js, you automatically get npm installed on your computer. https://nodejs.org/en/

Available Scripts In the project directory, you can run:

npm start Runs the app in the development mode. Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.
